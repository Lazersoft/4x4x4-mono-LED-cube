led-cube
========

A Processing.org GUI for designing 4x4x4 monochrome LED cube frames
Designed by Lance Levine 2014


This application creates frames for an LED cube. 
The frames are exported to a chosen text file. 
My LED cube runs on an Arduino Uno.
I have attached the arduino .ino file compatible with the LED cube output.
